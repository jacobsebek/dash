# > Dash >
Dash is a simple low-level data structure manipulation wrapper in C. It allows simplified access to files, nice string tools, queues and a vector type.

## How to use
The installation should be very simple. `dash/include/` is the include folder and `src/` is the source folder, therefore you can compile the library as `gcc -c -o dash.o ./src/vector.c` and so on.
